Very funny dicegame for ITHS2018

You can lock the dices with 1-5.
You can roll with spacebar.

Step1. click roll
Step2. click any or none dices to put them in your hand (your hand locks the dices)
Step3. If you want select a orange highlighted field with its corresponding score. Else click anything you want

If you dont see any dices you are probably using an ancient browser with no webp support.
Game ends when all fields have been clicked.
